# Roadmap

* Complete a homelab server deployment. Only running non graphical modules. Running containerised workloads for homeassistant and jellyfin.
* Design a coherant keyboard shortcut system built around home row mods. Primarily targeting colemak dh with fallback to querty on laptop keyboards. Consistent across layers e.g. os -> (application) kitty -> (nested application) neovim
* OS level shortcuts for assigning unique IDs to kitty windows and pinning those ids to workspaces. Scripts and keybindings that can switch directly to a kitty tab on any workspace.
