# Vision

A declarative, cross‑machine system that boots me straight into flow: Colemak DH layers, home‑row mods, near‑zero mouse use, and one‑command rebuilds on Linux, macOS, and my homelab servers. Its purpose is simple—cut every task to the fewest keystrokes, stay dependable for years, and share the journey in Git.
