# Vision

To craft a minimal and declarative development environment that is fast, efficient, and keyboard-centric. By favoring terminal-based tools and automating repetitive tasks, we enable developers to work at the speed of thought in a reproducible and consistent setting that encourages safe experimentation.

## Guiding Principles

* Minimal. Fast and simple with fewer moving parts.
* Keyboard Focused. Utilising keyboard shortcuts to move at the speed of thought.
* Terminal Focused. Prefering customisable terminal tools over one stop graphical applications.
* Efficiency Focused. Any commonly repeated activities should be automated away.
* Declarative. Reproducable and consistent environments that safely enable experimentation.
